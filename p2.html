        <p>Get a free AlchemyAPI key and IBM Bluemix account.</p>

		<h3>What's a key and why do I need one?</h3>

		<p>Responding to API requests takes server time and bandwidth, and these are not free, so most APIs won't let just anyone make any request they want. A key is a unique string of characters that allow you to interact with an API, and they are generally issued in tiers allowing different numbers of requests. The key we will be getting is a free tier key, allowing 1000 calls per day.</p>
		
		<h3>And I need an account?</h3>

		<p>I'm afraid so. This is the most annoying thing we will be doing, so once it's over we can start having fun. The IBM Bluemix account will allow you to get an AlchemyAPI key for free. The account itself is also free, although after the first 30 days they will require you to link a credit card to the account, which will not be charged if you stay in the free tier.</p>

		<h3>So let's get going!</h3>

		<p>Start by signing up for an IBM Bluemix account, <a href="https://console.ng.bluemix.net/registration/">available here.</a> All you need is an email address, although after 30 days you have to link a credit card to the account.</p>
		
		<p>Once the account is created you should have something that looks like this:</p>

		<p>Click on the "Watson" link, and then on the big plus symbol inside the light blue hexagon at the upper right. You should end up somewhere that looks like this:</p>
		<img src="images/Choose.JPG">
		<p>Now you just click on the first link that says "AlchemyAPI", select the "Free" tier, and hit the "Create" button in the bottom right hand corner. There you go! You now have a key!</p>
		
		<h3>I have a key? I don't see a key!</h3>

		<p>What, you thought this was intuitive? OK, if you don't already see a link to your AlchemyAPI plan, click the dropdown menu in the upper left corner labeled "Console" or "Watson" and select "Watson". You should now see a screen that looks like this:</p>	
		<img src="images/APIicon.JPG">
		<p>Click the icon to pull up your plan details, and then click the "Service Credentials" link to see your AlchemyAPI key. There you have it!</p>
