		<h3>What Can I Do Now?</h3>

		<p>This guide has only scratched the surface of the capabilities of AlchemyAPI, but hopefully it has been enough to enable you to start playing with it and finding things out on your own. The code I demonstrated is very simplistic, but you should be able to easily extend it into something that you can more easily input information into and retrieve results from.</p>
		
		<p>One issue with what we have developed in this guide is that it fully exposes the API key to anyone accessing the page. For this reason, these capabilities should only be used by you, the key owner. If you want to develop apps that others can use, you will need to perform the requests from a server to hide you key from users. The AlchemyAPI website links to several SDKs that would be useful in this regard.

		<p>The following are a list of links that may be helpful as you continue to explore the capabilites of AlchemyAPI:</p>
