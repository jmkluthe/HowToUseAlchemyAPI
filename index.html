        <p>A simple guide for getting started using the AlchemyAPI deep learning AI</p>
      </header>
      <section>
	  

		<h3>Welcome to my quickstart guide to exploring <a href="http://www.alchemyapi.com">AlchemyAPI</a>!</h3>

		<p>This guide is intended to allow a student or hobbyist to quickly gain access to and start playing with AlchemyAPI, an IBM Company that allows users to submit content for analysis by an artificial intelligence using deep learning algorithms.</p>

		<h3>What we will cover:</h3>

		<p>This guide will give you a rundown of the information you need to start using the AlchemyAPI application programming interface for simple webpage analysis. It will not, however, give you detailed information on how to start using the AlchemyAPI for useful applications. This topic is well explained by the official AlchemyAPI documentation, and this guide will provide direction on where to go next if you would like to continue on to more advanced applications.</p>
		
		<p>The topics in this guide are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Why should I use this guide?</li>
			<li>How to create and IBM Bluemix account and get a free API key.</li>
			<li>How to write a simple program to analyze a webpage.</li>
			<li>More complex analysis and examples.</li>
			<li>Where to go next.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h3>Why should I use this guide?</h3>

		<p>Before going any further, I should probably try to convince you that this guide will be useful to you. As I mentioned earlier, the AlchemyAPI website provides a considerable amount of documentation for the API, so what could I possibly tell you that you can't find there?</p>
		
		<p>The problem I found with the AlchemyAPI documentation is that it is intended for a developer who is ready to start building an application. If you are a student or a hobbyist who just wants to start making simple requests and seeing what the AI is capable of the documentation does not give you a quick and easy route to do so. This guide is intended to fill in that gap.

		<h3>What do I need?</h3>

		<p>For the purposes of this guide, all you need is a web browser, a text editor, and a little experience with html and javascript.</p>

		<h3>Seriously, that's it?</h3>

		<p>Seriously! Admittedly, you can't do much except play around with the API at this level. If, after playing around, you decide that you want to use it for something more serious, however, the official documentation includes links to SDKs for Java, Nodejs, IOS, Unity, Android, and Python. We will discuss some of this at the end of the guide.</p>
